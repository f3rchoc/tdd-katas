## Fizzbuzz
FizzBuzz is a fun game mostly played in elementary school.  
The rules are simple: when your turn arrives, you say the next number. However, if that number is a multiple of five, you should say the word “fizz” (preferably with a French accent) instead. If the number is a multiple of seven, you should say “buzz.” And if it is a multiple of both, you should say “fizzbuzz.” If you mess up, you’re out, and the game continues without you.
